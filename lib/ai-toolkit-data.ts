STEP 2, BUILD THE STRAND MAP:
"Create a structured table of all Strands and Sub-Strands in this curriculum. For each Sub-Strand include: the specific Learning Outcome(s), the recommended number of lessons, and the assessment type KNEC specifies for that Sub-Strand."

"Identify three Sub-Strands in [Learning Area 1] that naturally connect to Sub-Strands in [Learning Area 2]. For each: state the exact Learning Outcomes from both documents, and suggest one integrated activity a teacher in a rural Kenyan school with no equipment budget could facilitate."

STEP 4, GENERATE A QUICK REFERENCE CARD:
"Create a one-page Quick Reference Card for Term [X] Week [Y]. Include: the Sub-Strand I should be teaching, its Learning Outcomes, the Key Inquiry Question to anchor lessons around, recommended KNEC assessment tools, and two common learner misconceptions to watch for."

Grade: Grade 2
Class size: 45+ learners
Location: [e.g., A public school in Homa Bay County, near Lake Victoria, red laterite soil, fishing community]
Budget: Zero. Everything must come from the school compound or immediate surroundings.
Duration: 40 minutes outdoors

Generate the following, in this structure:

1. STORY-DRIVEN HOOK (2 minutes)
A 3-paragraph opening narrative featuring a Kenyan child with a local name. It must introduce the concept of soil types, use the local geography (lake, fishing, seasonal crops), and end with a question that launches the activity. Write it in English with a Kiswahili translation of the final hook question.

2. THE OUTDOOR GAME, "Mchanga Safari"
Step-by-step mechanics for 45+ learners, using ONLY: old tins or plastic bottles, water from a jerrycan, soil from the compound, banana leaves for surfaces. Specify how to divide 45 learners into groups using locally meaningful roles. Include exactly 3 psychomotor actions (touching, moulding, observing water absorption). Write it simply enough that a pupil monitor could help facilitate.

3. DIRECT REFLECTION PROMPTS (5 minutes)
6 questions progressing from observation to connection to creativity:
Q1-2 (Recall): What did you see, feel, smell?
Q3-4 (Connection): Where in your home or compound might you find this type of soil?
Q5-6 (Creativity): What could your family make or grow using this soil?

4. PARENTAL ENGAGEMENT TASK
One home follow-up using zero-cost household materials, in plain English and Kiswahili, suitable for a parent with Standard 7 education. Specify what evidence to collect, how to photograph or describe it, and which Google Classroom assignment to upload it to.

TASK FOR HOME (10-15 minutes, any evening this week):
1. Help your learner find [e.g., 3 different leaves, or bottle caps / vifuniko] in or around your house.
2. Ask them to arrange them in a repeating pattern (for example: Leaf, Cap, Leaf, Cap).
3. Ask them to EXPLAIN the pattern to you. This builds their Communication skill.

HOW TO SHARE WITH US:
Option A (easiest): Take a photo of the pattern and WhatsApp it to [Teacher Phone Number]. We will upload it for you.
Option B: Open the Google Classroom app, tap this assignment, press "Add Attachment", and upload your photo.

"Analyse all uploaded curriculum documents at once. Identify three Sub-Strands across different Learning Areas that share a genuine conceptual connection, not superficial topic similarity but deep links where mastering one Sub-Strand directly supports another. For each: state the exact Learning Outcome from each document, and explain in two sentences why these concepts reinforce each other."

- Address Learning Outcomes from at least 3 Learning Areas (cite the specific KICD outcomes)
- Solve a real problem people in [COUNTY] actually face
- Produce a tangible output a community member could use
- Be achievable with ZERO electricity, ZERO learner internet, and ZERO materials budget
- Use specific Kenyan names and places throughout
- Specify weekly milestones for checkpoint assessment"

STEP 3, GENERATE THE INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT MATRIX:
"Create an integrated assessment matrix. For each Learning Area, write rubric descriptors at all four KNEC levels (EE / ME / AE / BE). Each descriptor must describe observable learner BEHAVIOUR, what the teacher SEES the learner DO, not abstract qualities like 'good understanding'."`,

PART A, COMPUTER SCIENCE DEBUGGING EXERCISE:
Real-world Kenyan context: a Grade 10 learner in Thika is writing a Python program to track daily maize prices at Marikiti Market. It should (1) accept 5 daily prices, (2) calculate the average, (3) identify the week's highest and lowest price.

Write BUGGY CODE for this exact scenario with 4 deliberately introduced errors:
- Bug 1 (syntax, visible to beginners)
- Bug 2 (logic, requires algorithmic understanding)
- Bug 3 (runtime, only appears with specific price inputs)
- Bug 4 (off-by-one / edge case, requires advanced reasoning)

- Identify each bug with line numbers and explain in plain English what it does wrong
- Write the corrected code
- Predict the output for three test inputs that exercise each edge case

Grade: [e.g., Grade 8]
Learning Area: [e.g., Agriculture & Nutrition]
Assessment Task: [e.g., ZECC construction project]
Learner's KNEC Level: [e.g., AE1, Approaching Expectations]
Strengths observed: [e.g., clearly identified the preservation problem; resourcefully used clay pots]
Gaps observed: [e.g., inconsistent temperature measurements; no written reflection on what failed]
Learner context (optional): [e.g., first-generation learner, strong practically but weaker in writing, Dholuo is first language]

Generate THREE targeted feedback versions:

VERSION 1, GOOGLE CLASSROOM COMMENT (max 60 words): encouragement first, one specific strength, one precise next step, the exact revision required, and the deadline.

VERSION 2, DETAILED RUBRIC COMMENT (max 150 words): reference specific rubric criteria by name; explain in observable terms what AE1 looks like versus what ME1 requires; give 2-3 specific low-cost actions before resubmission; end with encouragement framed around Learning to Learn.

VERSION 3, GUARDIAN WHATSAPP MESSAGE (max 80 words): plain language, no jargon, optional Kiswahili; explain what the learner is working on and one 10-minute family support activity; frame in competency language, never percentages; include the upload instruction.`,

        prompt: `Upload your existing assessment tasks, rubrics, and the KNEC CBAF guidelines.

AUDIT 1, KNEC ALIGNMENT:
"Review my uploaded assessment for [Subject, Grade] against the KNEC CBAF requirements in my guidelines. List (a) 3 strengths, (b) 2 specific gaps or misalignments, (c) 1 concrete improvement. Cite the KNEC document page for each gap."

AUDIT 2, KENYA CONTEXT CHECK:
"Review the Kenyan authenticity of my performance task. Is the scenario one learners in [County] would recognise? Is the language free of Western idioms? Are the required materials genuinely available in rural Kenya? Suggest 3 specific changes to make it more locally relevant."

AUDIT 3, COMPETENCY COVERAGE:
"Which of CBC's 7 competencies does my assessment genuinely require the learner to demonstrate, not just mention? For each missing competency, suggest one element I could add without making the task longer."

AUDIT 4, DIFFERENTIATION CHECK:
"Does my assessment provide genuine entry points at BE, AE, ME, and EE? If a learner at BE cannot engage meaningfully, that is a design flaw, not a reflection of ability. Suggest one modification that creates a BE-accessible entry point without lowering the EE ceiling."

AUDIT 5, GENERATE A PARALLEL ASSESSMENT:
"Using the same design principles, challenge level, Kenyan-context approach, and competency focus, generate a completely parallel assessment for a different Sub-Strand in the same Learning Area. No shared questions, scenarios, or materials, but the same philosophy."
