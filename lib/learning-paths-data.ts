Wanjiru can recite the stages of the water cycle without pausing for breath. Baraka cannot recite them as fluently, but when the school's rain tank ran dry in February, he explained to his classmates why the county was seeding clouds, and what that had to do with evaporation. Under an examination that asks "List the stages of the water cycle," Wanjiru wins. Under almost any real situation either child will ever face, Baraka is the one who has learned.

The Competency-Based Curriculum exists because Kenya decided, as policy, that Baraka's kind of learning is the goal. A competency is not a softer alternative to knowledge. It is **knowledge, skills, and values working together in a real situation**. Baraka knows the water cycle; what makes him competent is that the knowledge is connected, usable, and his own.

## Why the reform happened

CBC did not appear from nowhere. Three pressures converged:

1. **Evidence from classrooms.** National assessments repeatedly showed learners passing examinations while unable to apply basic literacy and numeracy in unfamiliar contexts. The system was certifying recall, not capability.
2. **Evidence from the labour market.** Employers and tertiary institutions reported graduates strong on certificates and weak on problem solving, communication, and initiative, the very things work actually demands.
3. **A national vision.** The Basic Education Curriculum Framework (KICD, 2017) commits to nurturing every learner as an *engaged, empowered and ethical citizen*. Read that phrase slowly. None of those three words can be achieved by memorisation.

The structural change from 8-4-4 toward a competency-based structure (with early years, middle school, and senior school pathways) is the visible part. The invisible part is the one that lives or dies in your classroom: the shift in what counts as evidence of learning.

| Question the old system asked | Question CBC asks |
| --- | --- |
| What does this child know? | What can this child *do* with what they know? |
| Did we cover the syllabus? | Did the learners develop the outcome? |
| Who ranked highest? | What does each learner need next? |

>> KEY: CBC is not a new set of topics to cover. It is a new definition of success. Content still matters deeply, but content is now the raw material of competence, not the finish line.

## What changes in your Tuesday

Be suspicious of any description of CBC that stays abstract. Concretely, a competency-focused teacher does three things differently: they state outcomes as observable actions, they give learners genuine work that requires thinking (not just remembering), and they treat assessment as information rather than judgement. Everything else in this program builds on those three habits.

A common misconception is that CBC means projects, posters, and group seating, and that direct teaching is now forbidden. Wrong on both counts. A brilliant five-minute explanation is still brilliant teaching. The test is what happens *after* the explanation: do learners then use the idea to reason, make, decide, or explain, or do they copy it down and wait for the next one?

>> THINK: Imagine national examinations were abolished tomorrow. Which parts of your current teaching would you keep because they genuinely build capability, and which parts exist only because an exam is watching? Be honest. That second list is where CBC is inviting you to change.

>> TRY: In your next lesson, replace one "recall" question with a "use it" question. Instead of "What are the stages of the water cycle?" ask "Our school tank ran dry in February. Use the water cycle to explain why, and tell me one thing the school could do about it." Notice who comes alive.`,
          reflectionPrompt: 'Identify the single most exam-shaped habit in your current teaching, something you do mainly because an examination is watching. What would you replace it with if capability, not marks, were the only measure? Be specific about the lesson where you will try the replacement.',

          reading: `## Seven competencies, one design problem

CBC names seven core competencies every Kenyan learner must develop: **Communication and Collaboration, Critical Thinking and Problem Solving, Creativity and Imagination, Citizenship, Digital Literacy, Learning to Learn, and Self-Efficacy**. The list is easy to memorise, and that is exactly the trap. A competency listed on the chalkboard is decoration. A competency *demanded by the task* is development. The difference between the two is the entire craft of CBC teaching.

Here is the uncomfortable rule that follows: **a task develops a competency only if the task cannot be completed without it**. Group seating does not develop collaboration if one learner can do all the work. A "creative" poster does not develop creativity if every group copies the same diagram from the textbook. Before you credit a lesson with a competency, ask: could a learner finish this task without ever using that competency? If yes, the lesson is not developing it.

## What each one looks like when it is real

- **Communication and Collaboration**: a learner explains their method to a partner who must then use it; success depends on the explanation actually working.
- **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving**: learners meet a situation where the method is *not* given and must choose, test, and justify an approach.
- **Creativity and Imagination**: the task has more than one right answer, and learners must generate options before selecting one.
- **Citizenship**: learners weigh a real local issue, the school water point, the market's plastic waste, and connect their subject knowledge to a community decision.
- **Digital Literacy**: where devices exist, learners use them to create or find and *evaluate* information, not just to consume. Where they do not, learners can still learn to question sources.
- **Learning to Learn**: learners are asked how they got an answer, what confused them, and what they would do differently, and the teacher treats those answers as seriously as the content.
- **Self-Efficacy**: tasks are pitched so that effort visibly pays off; learners experience earned success, not rescued success.

>> CASE: A Grade 5 teacher in Kisumu taught fractions with one change. Instead of demonstrating equivalence on the board, she gave each group a different chapati-sharing problem with a deliberate twist: the shares could not come out even. Groups had to decide what "fair" meant, defend their split to another group, and write one sentence on what made the problem hard. One task: critical thinking (choosing a method), communication (defending it), self-efficacy (productive struggle that resolved). No competency was written on the board. All three happened.

## The competency audit

Take any lesson plan you have taught this term and run this three-question audit:

1. Which competency does the *main activity* actually force learners to use?
2. At what moment in the lesson would I have *seen* it happening?
3. If I cannot answer the first two, what one change to the task would create that moment?

This audit is more valuable than any list. Teachers who run it weekly report that their plans change in a consistent direction: fewer activities, each demanding more.

>> THINK: Which of the seven competencies do you, as a professional adult, use least in your own working week? Teachers tend to under-design for the competencies they are least comfortable exercising themselves. Sit with that for a moment before you plan next week.

>> TRY: Run the three-question audit on tomorrow's lesson plan. If question 1 has no honest answer, change one task, not the whole plan, so that finishing it requires explaining, choosing, or creating.`,
          reflectionPrompt: 'Run the competency audit on a lesson you taught this week: which competency did the main activity genuinely force learners to use, and at what moment could you have seen it? If the honest answer is "none", redesign that one activity and describe the new version.',

          ],
          reading: `## The comparison that actually matters

Most CBC training compares the two systems with a table, so let us start with one, then go one level deeper than the table can.

| Dimension | 8-4-4 | CBC |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose of assessment | Rank learners after learning | Inform teaching during learning |
| Curriculum unit | Subjects with syllabi to cover | Strands and sub-strands with outcomes to develop |
| Evidence of success | Examination score | Demonstrated performance against criteria |
| Teacher's centre of gravity | Transmitting content | Designing and guiding experiences |
| Learner's role | Receive, retain, reproduce | Explore, apply, explain, create |

The deepest row is the first. In 8-4-4, assessment happened *after* learning and its product was a rank. In CBC, assessment happens *during* learning and its product is a decision: what does this learner need next? Educational researchers call this **assessment for learning**, and decades of evidence (most famously Black and Wiliam's research synthesis) show it produces some of the largest learning gains of any classroom intervention, especially for the lowest-attaining learners. You will spend a whole program on this later. For now, hold the distinction.

## What does NOT change

This lesson must also correct an overcorrection. CBC does **not** mean:

- **Content stops mattering.** You cannot think critically about fractions without knowing fractions. Competence is built *on* knowledge; a curriculum that abandons knowledge produces confident incompetence.
- **Direct teaching is banned.** Clear explanation, modelling, and worked examples remain essential tools. What changes is what follows them.
- **Rigour drops.** Explaining *why* an answer is right is harder than producing the answer. Done honestly, CBC raises the cognitive bar; it does not lower it.

## The ritual trap

Here is the failure mode to watch for in your own school: classrooms that perform CBC's *rituals*, learners in groups, manila paper on walls, "learner-centred" written in the scheme of work, while the *thinking* remains exactly as it was. Five learners around one desk copying one answer is 8-4-4 with the furniture rearranged. The question that cuts through every ritual is always the same: **who is doing the cognitive work?** If the answer is "the teacher" or "one learner per group", the reform has not reached that classroom yet, whatever the seating says.

>> KEY: CBC is a change in pedagogy, not a change in furniture. A teacher lecturing brilliantly and then making every learner apply the idea is more CBC than a silent groupwork lesson where no one had to think.

>> THINK: Recall one groupwork lesson you have taught or observed that produced no real thinking. What exactly went wrong, the task, the group structure, the accountability? Naming the mechanism is the first step to never repeating it.

>> TRY: Next groupwork lesson, add one line to the instructions: "Anyone in your group may be asked to explain the answer." Then actually pick the quiet ones. Watch how the group's behaviour changes when explanation can land on anyone.`,

          reading: `## The curriculum design is a map, not a cage

Open any KICD curriculum design and you will find the same anatomy: an **essence statement** explaining why the learning area exists, **strands** (the broad organising themes), **sub-strands** (focused topics within each strand), **specific learning outcomes** (SLOs) for each sub-strand, **suggested learning experiences**, **key inquiry questions**, and links to core competencies, values, and pertinent and contemporary issues (PCIs). Most teachers read only the SLO column. The teachers who plan best read two more: the *key inquiry questions*, which hand you ready-made lesson hooks, and the *essence statement*, which tells you what the whole learning area is for, the test you should hold every lesson against.

In English, for example, "Reading" is a strand, "Reading Comprehension" a sub-strand, and an SLO under it might read: *"By the end of the sub-strand, the learner should be able to make inferences from a text read."*

## Unpacking an SLO

An SLO has three working parts, and unpacking them is a precise skill:

1. **The verb**, what the learner will *do*. This is the assessable heart. "Make inferences" demands different teaching than "identify" or "recall".
2. **The content**, what the verb operates on: a text, a number pattern, a map, a seed.
3. **The implied evidence**, what you would accept as proof. If the verb is "make inferences", the evidence must be a learner producing an inference you never taught them. A learner repeating an inference you modelled is evidence of memory, not of the outcome.

The verb deserves real attention because verbs sit at different cognitive depths. "Identify" and "list" sit low: necessary, but easy. "Explain", "compare", and "classify" sit in the middle: they require understanding. "Design", "justify", and "evaluate" sit high: they require judgement. A week of lessons whose outcomes are all low-verb is a week where nobody had to think hard. KICD's designs deliberately mix the levels; your schemes of work should preserve that mix rather than flattening everything to "identify".

### Beware the unassessable outcome

Some outcome statements feel virtuous but cannot be observed: *"appreciate the importance of fractions", "be aware of pollution"*. What does appreciation look like? How would awareness fail? If you cannot describe what evidence would show the outcome was met, and what its *absence* would look like, the outcome cannot steer a lesson. Translate it: "appreciate fractions" might become *"use fractions to solve a sharing problem and explain why the answer is fair"*. Now you can teach toward it and assess it.

>> CASE: A Grade 4 science teacher in Nyeri unpacked the SLO "classify materials according to whether they are transparent, translucent or opaque." Verb: classify, so learners must *sort and justify*, not recite definitions. Content: real materials, so she collected polythene, a glass bottle, exercise book paper, and a kiondo. Evidence: each learner places one material and says *because*. Her assessment took four minutes at the end of the lesson and told her exactly which six learners confused translucent with transparent, and that is next lesson's starter sorted.

>> KEY: The SLO is a contract with yourself: the verb tells you what learners must do, and what learners must do tells you what evidence to collect. If your activity and your evidence do not match the verb, the lesson drifts, however pleasant it feels.

>> TRY: Take one outcome from this week's scheme of work and write its three parts in the margin: verb, content, evidence-I-will-accept. If the verb is "know" or "appreciate", translate it into something a learner can visibly do.`,
          reflectionPrompt: 'Take one vague or unassessable outcome you have worked with ("appreciate...", "be aware of...", "understand..."). Translate it into an observable SLO, then state exactly what evidence you would accept that a learner has met it, and what its absence would look like.',

          reading: `## The question that defines learner-centredness

Forget the seating plan. A lesson is learner-centred when one question has the right answer: **who is doing the thinking?** A silent class watching a masterful explanation is teacher-centred. The same class, two minutes later, using that explanation to attack a problem the teacher has *not* solved for them, is learner-centred. The label belongs to moments, not lessons, and your job as a designer is to engineer more of those moments.

This reframing matters because the common alternative, "learner-centred means the teacher talks less", produces bad lessons. The teacher's expertise does not shrink in CBC; it relocates. It moves out of the performance and into two places: **the design of the task** and **the quality of the questions** asked while learners work.

## Designing for productive struggle

The engine of learning is what researchers call *productive struggle*: a task hard enough that learners must genuinely think, structured enough that the struggle leads somewhere. Three design principles create it:

1. **Attempt before explanation.** Pose the problem *first*. Let learners try, fail, and form questions, then explain. An explanation that answers a question learners already have lands ten times harder than one that answers a question nobody asked.
2. **Low floor, high ceiling.** Every learner can start (the floor is low); the task can stretch as far as your strongest learner can go (the ceiling is high). "Find as many ways as you can to make 24" beats "What is 4 by 6?" because both the struggling and the swift have somewhere to go.
3. **Built-in accountability.** Structure tasks so no learner can hide: think-pair-share where either partner may report, group roles that rotate, mini-whiteboards where every learner answers at once.

## The questions you ask while they work

Learner-centred teaching is mostly a questioning discipline:

- **Wait.** After asking, count three full seconds before taking an answer. Research on wait time shows answers get longer, more learners volunteer, and reasoning improves, for free.
- **Cold-call warmly.** "Hands up" hands the lesson to the same five learners every day. Choose who answers; keep the tone safe; make "I am not sure yet, come back to me" an acceptable first response and then actually come back.
- **Probe rather than confirm.** The most valuable follow-up questions are: *How do you know? Would that still work if...? Can you say that another way? Does anyone disagree?* Notice that none of these reveal whether the answer was right, which keeps everyone thinking.

>> CASE: A Standard 6 teacher in Machakos taught grammar rules by stating them, until she inverted one lesson. She gave pairs a short text and one instruction: "Find the pattern in how these five sentences begin, and write the rule yourselves." Pairs argued, tested, rewrote. Her rule, revealed at the end, confirmed what most had already constructed. Same content, same 35 minutes. The difference: thirty children built a rule instead of receiving one, and three weeks later most could still apply it.

>> THINK: In your last lesson, estimate honestly: how many minutes did *learners* spend thinking hard, not listening, not copying, thinking? If the number embarrasses you slightly, you are exactly where most good teachers start.

>> TRY: Invert one explanation this week. Pose the problem first, give pairs four minutes of attempt, collect two different approaches on the board, *then* explain. Notice how the explanation changes when it responds to their attempts.`,

Before this lesson gives you a single list of materials, take its only rule: **a resource is good if it makes learners think, and decorative if it does not**. A projector showing a diagram learners passively watch is decoration. A handful of beans that forces a learner to physically confront why 3 groups of 4 make 12 is technology, in the truest sense. Apply this test ruthlessly and most resource decisions make themselves.

## The textbook: servant, not master

KICD-approved textbooks are written to support the curriculum designs, not to replace them. The design document, not the textbook, defines the outcomes. Practically, this means you plan from the SLO and *then* ask what the textbook offers, rather than letting chapter order become your scheme of work. A textbook exercise is a resource like any other: sometimes the best available, sometimes beaten by three bottle tops and a good question. Teachers who let the textbook drive report "covering" more and their learners retaining less; the book sets a pace no actual class of children has ever matched.

## The free laboratory outside your window

The school compound, the market, the home: these are not backup options for under-resourced schools. They are often *better* than commercial materials, because competence means using knowledge in the real world, and they are the real world:

- **The compound**: ecosystems, measurement (perimeter of the flag area, no rulers, learners must improvise units), soil types, water drainage, data collection (count and classify vehicles passing the gate).
- **The community**: a parent who keeps bees, a fundi who uses geometry daily without naming it, a grandmother who knows the medicinal plants the science book lists abstractly. One guest with real expertise beats a week of secondhand description.
- **Improvised materials**: bottle tops for place value, sticks for angle work, flour-paste for models. Treat improvisation as a design discipline, not a hardship: the question is never "what can I find?" but "what does this *outcome* need learners to manipulate?"

## Digital, with honesty

Where devices and connectivity exist, the Kenya Education Cloud, recorded experiments, and simulations genuinely extend what you can show. Two honest cautions. First, a video can create the *feeling* of understanding without the substance; always follow viewing with a task that proves the idea transferred ("now explain it to your partner with the diagram hidden"). Second, the pedagogy shift in CBC requires no electricity whatsoever. A school with no devices and strong questioning is implementing CBC. A smart screen showing learners content they passively consume is not.

>> KEY: Resources do not have a hierarchy of prestige, textbook above beans, screen above compound. They have a hierarchy of *thinking demanded*. Choose whatever makes the cognitive work unavoidable.

>> THINK: What expertise walks past your school gate every single day, in parents, traders, artisans, elders, that your learners' textbooks describe secondhand? Why has the school never asked it in?

>> TRY: For one lesson this week, plan the resource *after* writing the SLO, asking only: "What must learners handle, see, or visit for this outcome to become real?" If the honest answer is "nothing, they need a hard question", that is also a resource decision, and a good one.`,

Most lesson plans are written forwards: pick a topic, choose activities, and hope assessment fits at the end. Strong CBC plans are written **backwards**, a discipline known internationally as backward design (Wiggins and McTighe), and it has exactly three steps, in this order:

1. **Outcome.** What will learners be able to do? (Your SLO, verb and all.)
2. **Evidence.** What will I accept as proof, from *every* learner, not just volunteers? Decide this *before* thinking about activities.
3. **Experiences.** Now, and only now, design activities, chosen because they manufacture that evidence.

The order is the whole trick. Teachers who choose activities first end up with engaging lessons that prove nothing; the activity was chosen for its energy, not its evidence. Teachers who choose evidence first find activities almost design themselves.

## The shape of the lesson

The familiar Kenyan plan structure, introduction, development, conclusion, holds, but each part earns its place:

| Phase | Its real job | The trap to avoid |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Introduction (5-8 min) | Activate what learners already know and make them *want* the answer. The curriculum design's key inquiry questions are ready-made hooks. | "Last week we did X, today we will do Y", informs, but awakens nothing. |
| Development (20-25 min) | Learners work toward the outcome, attempt, instruction, application. Differentiation is *planned here*, not improvised. | The teacher performs while learners watch; the bell decides when thinking ends. |
| Conclusion (5-7 min) | Collect the evidence you specified in step 2, from everyone. | "Any questions? Good." Silence is not data. |

Two refinements separate adequate plans from strong ones. First, **plan for the learner who finishes in four minutes and the one who needs fourteen** before the lesson, an extension question for the first, a scaffold (a hint card, a worked first step, a peer pairing) for the second. Improvised differentiation is usually just "help the slow ones while the fast ones get bored". Second, **share success criteria**: tell learners, in their language, what a good answer will include. Better still, show a strong and a weak example and let them tell you the difference. Learners who know what success looks like start managing their own progress, which is the competency Learning to Learn, arriving by design.

>> CASE: A Grade 6 mathematics teacher in Embu planned a lesson on area of irregular shapes backwards. Evidence decided first: "each learner estimates the area of our staffroom's L-shaped floor and defends the estimate in one sentence." Only then did she pick activities: grid-paper practice, then the actual corridor with string and chalk. Her old plan for this topic had learners colouring rectangles. Same SLO on paper; an entirely different lesson, because the evidence was chosen first.

>> KEY: A lesson plan is a hypothesis: "if learners do these things, they will be able to demonstrate this outcome." The conclusion of the lesson is where you test the hypothesis. If you never collect the evidence, you are not planning, you are scheduling.

>> TRY: Write tomorrow's plan in reverse order on a single page: outcome at the top, evidence in the middle, activities last. Many teachers report this one structural change does more for their planning than any template ever did.`,

          reading: `## Records that serve teaching, not inspection

Be honest about why most records get written: because someone might check. Records written for inspection are dead paper, complete, neat, and never consulted. CBC record keeping has a different test: **a record is good if it changes a future teaching decision**. A note that tells you which six learners cannot yet regroup in subtraction changes Monday's starter. A page of ticks tells you nothing you will ever act on. Write for the first purpose and inspection takes care of itself.

## What is actually worth recording

CBC performance is described against four levels: **Exceeds expectations, Meets expectations, Approaches expectations, Below expectations**. The levels only mean something when they are anchored to a specific outcome, "Meets expectations *at making inferences from a text*", never as a general grade for a child. Three kinds of record carry almost all the value:

1. **Progress against specific outcomes.** A simple class grid, learners down the side, the term's key SLOs across the top, filled with the four levels (or initials: E, M, A, B). Ten seconds per learner per outcome, and at a glance you can see both a child's profile and an outcome the whole class missed.
2. **Anecdotal notes, for significant moments only.** Do not narrate every lesson. Record the surprising: the quiet learner who gave the best justification this term, the persistent misconception, the leap. Two sentences with a date. These notes write your end-of-term comments and your parent conversations for you.
3. **Portfolio evidence, learner-curated.** A portfolio is not a folder of everything; it is a small set of *chosen* work that shows growth. Make learners choose what enters it and require one sentence: "I chose this because...". The choosing is itself assessment, learners judging their own work against criteria, and it transfers part of the record-keeping burden to its rightful owners.

## The sustainability system

The collapse pattern is always the same: a beautiful system in week one, abandoned by week five. Sustainable systems are built on sampling, not coverage:

- **Five learners a day.** Deliberately observe five (a rotating list), not all forty. Every child gets focused attention roughly weekly, which is more than "watch everyone" ever truly delivers.
- **Three minutes, same time, every day.** Update the grid immediately after the last lesson, while memory is fresh. Daily three-minute habits survive; Saturday backlogs do not.
- **Shorthand without guilt.** E/M/A/B plus an occasional word. The record's value is in its pattern over weeks, not the prose of any entry.

>> CASE: A Grade 3 teacher in Bungoma kept one A4 grid per learning area and a sticky-note pad in her pocket. During group work she wrote at most three notes a day, only surprises. At week's end, transferring notes took ten minutes. When a parent asked in October why their son's reading level had been moved, she answered with five dated observations spanning two terms. The parent stopped doubting the system; so, she admits, did she.

>> THINK: Find one record you have kept this term. Has it changed a single teaching decision? If yes, you already know what good looks like, make more of that. If no, what would you have needed to record instead for it to have mattered?

>> TRY: Rule one class-grid this weekend: learners down the side, this term's five most important SLOs across the top. Fill it from memory tonight, gaps included. The gaps are the point: they show you which learners you have no evidence about at all.`,
          reflectionPrompt: 'Look at your current records with the one test that matters: which record last changed a teaching decision you made, and which records exist only because someone might check?

When a parent complains that their child's exercise book is too empty, hear what they are actually saying: *I care about this child's future, and the only dashboard I have ever known for it is bookwork and marks.* That parent passed through 8-4-4. Their definition of a good education was earned honestly. Treating their concern as ignorance to be corrected loses them; treating it as love that needs a better dashboard wins them. Every technique in this lesson rests on that reframe.

It helps to remember that CBC policy itself names **parental empowerment and engagement** as a pillar of the curriculum, parents are designed into this reform, not bolted on. The teacher who communicates well is implementing the curriculum, not doing public relations.

## Replace the old dashboard, concretely

Telling parents "CBC develops competencies" replaces something concrete with something abstract, and abstractions lose to full exercise books every time. Replace concrete with concrete:

- **Show the work itself.** Once a term, run a fifteen-minute portfolio conversation: the child walks the parent through three pieces they chose, explaining what improved between piece one and piece three. A parent who has watched their own child *explain their growth* never asks about empty exercise books again. The child does the convincing; you only host.
- **Send evidence, not adjectives.** "Amina is doing well" reassures for a day. "This week Amina measured the shamba plot and converted the units herself, ask her to pace out your kitchen tonight" gives the parent something to *see* and a part to *play*.
- **Give them their role back.** Many parents fear CBC means expensive materials and projects they cannot support. Tell them the truth: the most powerful home contribution is conversation. "Ask your child to teach you what they learned, the explaining is the revision." A parent who cannot read English can still do this in any language, and it is worth more than bought manila paper.

## When resistance stays

Some scepticism survives all of this, often arriving as: *"All this is fine, but will my child pass?"* Do not dodge it; the question deserves a straight answer. Assessment in this system includes school-based assessments feeding national records, and the deeper preparation for any examination is the ability to read an unfamiliar question, reason about it, and explain an answer, which is precisely what competency-based teaching practises daily. A child who can apply knowledge to a new situation is exam-ready *and* life-ready; a child who can only recall is, at best, half of one.

| Instead of saying | Say |
| --- | --- |
| "CBC develops 21st-century competencies." | "Your daughter is learning to use what she knows, ask her to show you tonight." |
| "We no longer focus on exams." | "She is practising the exact skill exams reward: facing a new problem and reasoning through it." |
| "Group work builds collaboration." | "She had to explain her method until her partner could use it, that is how you prove you really know something." |

>> THINK: Picture your most sceptical parent, the specific face. What evidence would convince *you*, in their seat, with their history? Now ask honestly: has your classroom produced that evidence yet, and has it ever travelled home?

>> TRY: This week, send home three sentences about one specific learner: what they can now do, one concrete example, and one thing to try at home together. Count the cost (four minutes) against the return when that parent next meets you.`,

Unlike a test, it captures the process of learning — drafts, revisions, self-assessments, and finished products. In CBC, portfolios are a core assessment tool because they provide rich, multidimensional evidence of competency development that a single assessment cannot.\n\nFor practical implementation, a simple physical portfolio can be a manila folder or exercise book for each learner. Include: 2–3 work samples per term (chosen by the learner), teacher observation notes, learner self-assessment records, and one "best piece" with a written explanation. Label clearly and store systematically. The portfolio belongs to the learner — their ownership of it is itself an expression of the Learning to Learn competency.`,

When a learner selects a piece to include and writes "I chose this because..." they are practising the Self-Efficacy and Learning to Learn competencies at the same time.\n\nEven young learners can engage in portfolio reflection with scaffolding. Prompts like "I am proud of this because..." or "This was hard for me, and I solved it by..." build the habit of self-reflection from early grades. Over time, learners develop a meta-awareness of their own learning journey — they can see their growth in ways that a grade on a page cannot show.`,

This shifts the dynamic from the teacher judging the learner to the learner taking ownership of their progress. Parents see real work, hear their child explain it, and gain understanding of competency-based growth.\n\nTo make portfolio sharing events successful: prepare learners with a 2-minute presentation structure ("This is my best work because... I grew in this area by... My next goal is..."); invite parents to ask questions of the learner, not just the teacher; use the rubric to explain performance levels in parent-friendly language.

          reading: `STEM education — Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics — is more than teaching these subjects separately. It is an integrated approach where learners apply concepts from multiple disciplines to solve real problems. In a STEM lesson, a learner might apply mathematics to measure, science to hypothesise, engineering to design, and technology to build — all in service of a single challenge.\n\nKenya recognised STEM\'s importance to national development early. CEMASTEA (Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology Education in Africa) has worked for decades to build STEM teaching capacity. CBC provides the curriculum context: its emphasis on Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Creativity maps perfectly onto STEM\'s inquiry-based approach.`,

Mathematics provides the quantitative tools for all STEM fields. Pre-Technical Studies (Upper Primary) introduces engineering design and making. Even Creative Arts contributes design thinking — the iterative process of designing, building, testing, and improving.\n\nThe CBC Science & Technology strand structure explicitly includes inquiry: learners are expected to investigate, design, make, and evaluate. This maps directly to STEM pedagogy. When planning STEM-integrated lessons, look for natural connections: a lesson on fractions becomes a cooking measurement challenge; a lesson on ecosystems becomes a water quality investigation; a lesson on structures becomes a bridge-building challenge.`,

It requires intentional noticing: as you plan a science investigation, ask "what mathematics is embedded here?" As you teach a geography lesson, ask "what engineering or technology concepts connect?" Small, regular cross-curricular links are more powerful than occasional "STEM days" because they build persistent habits of integrated thinking.`,

Within this arc, each daily STEM session follows a mini-structure: brief check-in (5 min), work time (30 min), debrief (5 min).\n\nManagement challenges are real in large classes: noise, access to materials, uneven team contributions. Strategies that help: assign roles within each group (materials manager, recorder, timekeeper, presenter); create clear material stations rather than distributing everything at once; use a visual project tracker on the wall so groups can see their progress.

**The Three Phases of Burnout**

Burnout rarely arrives overnight. Phase one is enthusiasm erosion — lessons that used to energise you feel flat. Phase two is disillusionment — persistent cynicism about learners, colleagues, or the system. Phase three is depletion — emotional numbness and a sense that nothing you do matters.

**Early Warning Signs**

The most commonly missed signals: dreading Monday from Saturday afternoon; feeling resentful when a learner asks a question you've answered hundreds of times; increasing difficulty separating from work thoughts during personal time; physical symptoms like disrupted sleep, frequent illness, or persistent headaches.

**Why Teaching in Kenya Is Particularly Demanding**

CBC implementation has added substantial new complexity to an already demanding role. Teachers are expected to be curriculum designers, counsellors, assessors, and administrators simultaneously — often with inadequate training, large class sizes, and limited resources. Recognising these systemic pressures is not complaining; it is accurate accounting of your professional reality.`,

**The Stress Response**

When you perceive a threat — an angry parent, a collapsing lesson, 60 noisy learners — your body releases cortisol and adrenaline. Heart rate rises, focus narrows, and non-urgent systems (immune response, empathic processing) are temporarily suppressed. This is helpful for short-term challenges.

The problem begins when this response is chronically activated. In a demanding teaching environment, your nervous system may rarely fully return to baseline. Over weeks and months, elevated cortisol levels reduce patience and impulse control, suppress the immune system, and decrease creative thinking — exactly the capacities that make great teaching possible.

**Recovery Is a Professional Requirement**

Many teachers feel guilty about rest, especially during CBC workload peaks. But recovery is not the opposite of productivity — it is the precondition for it. A teacher operating at 60% on a rested brain is more effective than one at 100% on an exhausted one. Sleep, brief physical activity, social connection, and time without professional responsibility are biological inputs that make sustained teaching possible.`,

**The CBC Transition Burden**

Teachers are learning a new framework while teaching it, with inadequate training, limited resources, and without seeing the full curriculum picture for their learners. This ambiguity creates chronic low-level anxiety that is easy to internalise as personal incompetence. It is a systems challenge being absorbed by individual teachers.

**Class Size Realities**

A class of 50+ learners requires individualised CBC assessment for every child. The emotional labour of maintaining positive, attentive relationships with 50 individuals — tracking their competencies, family situations, and wellbeing — is enormous. Acknowledging this is not complaining; it is accurate accounting of your work.

**Community Expectations**

In many Kenyan communities, teachers are expected to be available at all times. While this trust is meaningful, it extends professional responsibility into all areas of personal life. Communicating clearly and kindly about your availability is a professional skill, not rudeness.

**Financial Stress**

TSC salary delays, school-level financial expectations, and the cost of maintaining classroom resources from personal funds add material stress that affects wellbeing. These are systemic issues that deserve collective solutions — and individual acknowledgement.`,

Between lessons, your brain is still processing the previous class while preparing for the next. Without a reset, stress accumulates through the day. A simple 2-minute transition ritual — stepping outside briefly, taking 5 deep breaths, naming one thing that went well in the last lesson — breaks this accumulation.

**Box Breathing**

When you notice rising tension, box breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system within 90 seconds. Inhale for 4 counts. Hold for 4. Exhale for 4. Hold for 4. Repeat 3–4 times. This is evidence-based, invisible to others, and requires nothing except 90 seconds of intention.

**Preparation Periods**

Research consistently shows that preparation periods used entirely for marking leave teachers more depleted, not less. Splitting prep time — 70% task-focused, 30% deliberately resting your thinking — produces better quality work and more sustainable energy across the day.

**The Shutdown Practice**

At the end of the working day, review your task list, update your plan for tomorrow, and say (or think) "shutdown complete." This signals to your brain that professional processing is done for the day — reducing the intrusive work thoughts that occupy personal time and fragment recovery.`,

          reading: `The most common reason teachers give for not setting limits is guilt — a feeling that a "real" teacher would always say yes. This lesson reframes boundaries as professional stewardship, not selfishness.

**Boundaries Protect Learners**

A teacher who never sets limits gradually becomes depleted. A depleted teacher has less patience, creativity, and emotional presence available for the class. Setting appropriate limits on your availability is, ultimately, a professional act of care for your learners.

**Common Situations and Responses**

*Parent messages after 8pm:* "Thank you for reaching out. I'll respond during school hours tomorrow."

*Unplanned extra duties:* "I want to do this well — could you tell me which current responsibility this replaces, or should we discuss with the head teacher?"

*Colleagues expecting unlimited support:* "I have 20 minutes now — is that enough? If we need longer, can we find a time that works for both of us?"

None of these responses are unkind. They are honest and they protect your capacity to teach.

**Caring Versus Absorbing**

There is a difference between caring about a learner's situation and taking on their distress as your own. You can hold compassion for a struggling family without personally solving their problems. This distinction — clearly understood — is the foundation of sustainable teaching.`,

          reading: `Most Kenyan teachers end a school holiday still feeling tired. This is because rest without intention rarely produces recovery. Understanding the types of rest — and planning deliberately for each — transforms holidays from administrative gaps into genuine restoration.

**Three Types of Rest**

*Physical rest* is sleep and reduced physical demand. Seven to eight hours of sleep per night consistently produces measurable improvements in mood, patience, and cognitive function within 5–7 days.

*Cognitive rest* is time without professional thinking. Checking curriculum resources, planning lessons, and reading education circulars all use the same mental resources as teaching. True cognitive rest requires at least 4–5 consecutive days with no professional reading or planning.

*Emotional rest* is time without being the person who is needed. For teachers who are also community resources, this can be the rarest form of rest. It requires deliberately communicating reduced availability and spending time in relationships where you receive care rather than only giving it.

**The First and Last Weeks of Term**

The first week back is often the most draining. Deliberately planning gentler activities — review and reconnection rather than new content — preserves energy for the rest of term. Similarly, planning the final week as reduced-load protects quality to the very last day and creates psychological closure.`,

**What Effective Peer Support Looks Like**

It often begins with two colleagues who agree to a weekly 15-minute check-in — not about logistics, but about how they are actually managing. "What worked this week? What are you struggling with?" — asked and answered honestly between trusted colleagues — does more for sustained wellbeing than many formal training events.

**Starting the Conversation**

Many teachers feel uncomfortable initiating wellbeing conversations, especially where professional stoicism is valued. A simple entry: "I've been finding [specific challenge] really hard this term. Have you had anything similar?" This invitation is almost universally met with relief rather than discomfort.

**Building on What Exists**

Most schools have informal peer relationships that can be intentionally deepened. The lunch break that could include one honest conversation. The staff group chat used for logistics that could also hold a weekly reflection question. The colleague who already checks on you — who could you offer that to in return?

These small, consistent investments in professional relationships are among the most evidence-based and lowest-cost interventions for teacher wellbeing available.`,

**The Minimum Viable Lesson Plan**

A CBC lesson plan needs: a clear learning outcome, an engaging activity, a formative check. It does not need to be a multi-page document for every lesson. Scheme of work and classroom lesson notes are different things — many teachers merge them unnecessarily due to anxiety or unclear school requirements.

Identify what your school actually requires versus what you are producing from habit. The gap is often significant and reducible.

**Batching Assessment**

Spreading assessment recording throughout the week means your brain never fully exits assessment mode. Designating two focused windows per week for all recording reduces both the total time and the cognitive residue. Involving learners in self-assessment and peer assessment is both pedagogically sound (CBC explicitly requires learner agency) and practically lightening.

**Strategic Prioritisation**

Not every request requires a yes. Developing clarity about what directly serves your learners — and politely declining what doesn't — is a professional skill that accumulates into significant workload reduction over a term. This is not laziness; it is professional stewardship.`,

**Purpose as a Buffer Against Burnout**

Research on occupational wellbeing consistently finds that sense of purpose is the strongest predictor of sustained engagement in demanding careers. Purpose doesn't mean feeling inspired every day — it means having a clear enough answer to "why am I doing this?" to navigate the days when the answer feels distant.

**Finding Your Teaching Why**

Reflect: When was the last time you felt genuinely effective as a teacher? What was happening? Who was involved? What specifically did you do? These answers point toward your professional values — the anchor you return to during difficult periods.

Common teaching "whys" among Kenyan teachers: seeing a first-generation learner access opportunities their parents couldn't. Watching a struggling child grasp something after weeks of patience. Building something in a community that will outlast your own presence there.

**Designing Joy Into Practice**

Joy in teaching is not something that happens to you — it is something you design. One topic per term that genuinely excites you. One lesson per week that you would be happy to have observed, not because it is perfect but because it is authentically yours. One learner per class who responds most visibly to what you offer.

These small designs, compounded across a career, create a teaching life that sustains itself.`,
